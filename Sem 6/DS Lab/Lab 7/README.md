## Combination of network topology and inter-process communication

> 1. Write a server (TCP) program that opens a listening socket and waits to server client. It also consists of 3 modules of three topology creation (tree, ring, star).
> 2. Write a client (TCP) program that connects with the server program knowing IP address and port number.
> 3. Get the input topology, number of nodes from console on client and send it to server, server construct the topology on request and send the adjacency list and degree of the node to the client. Client will display the adjacency list and degree of nodes on its own console.
